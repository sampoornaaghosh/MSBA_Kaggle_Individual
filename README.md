## Business Problem and Project Objective :
Home Credit Group is a non-banking financial institution that provides loans to people with little or no credit history. These borrowers are often considered high-risk, so Home Credit needs to be able to accurately predict which borrowers are most likely to default on their loans. The Home Credit Default Risk project aims to create a model that can accurately predict whether or not a borrower will default on their loan. The project dataset contains over 100 million rows of data, including information on loan applications, demographic data, and historical credit behavior. Home Credit Company can use the winning model to improve their loan approval process and reduce default rates. The Home Credit Default Risk project can significantly impact millions of people's lives. By accurately predicting which borrowers are most likely to default, Home Credit can be more selective in their loan approvals, which will help to reduce the number of defaults. This will ultimately benefit both Home Credit and its borrowers, as it will allow Home Credit to continue providing loans to people who need them while also reducing the risk of financial loss.

## Solution to the Business Problem : 
We concluded that the best modeling method was building a gradient-boosted tree model to predict loan defaults. The model could model non-linear relationships, handle large datasets and be faster. It was also less sensitive to outliers and could address data imbalance by oversampling. The model could access essential features, which could be used to improve the accuracy of defaulter identification.

## My contribution to the Project :
I specifically created several helpful visualizations that helped the team understand the data. These visualizations included histograms, scatter plots, pie charts, etc. I identified several essential features in the dataset that were not previously known. I built a logistic regression model that achieved an accuracy of 94.53%. I could explain the results of my model clearly and concisely to my group.

## Difficulties faced : 
We encountered several difficulties along the way, including data collection, validation, model selection, and interpretation of the results. The data collection process was not as streamlined as we would have liked, and the data was not always in a consistent format. This made it difficult to clean and prepare the data for analysis. Additionally, the data we used was only sometimes validated at the source, leading to several errors. This made it difficult to build accurate models. Deciding which model was the best fit was also challenging since knowing which would perform best was too much work. We used a gradient-boosted tree model, giving us the best accuracy and performance among the models we built.
Overall we achieved a successful outcome despite the difficulties we encountered. However, we could have achieved even better results if we had addressed some of these issues earlier in the project.

## Recommended Solution : 
In conclusion, we observed a 17% increase in correctly predicting default compared to a 50/50 guess. This 17% increase captures defaulters typically receiving a loan, which translates to savings for Home Credit. We recommend that the Home Credit gather the details related to the essential features derived from the model to improve the accuracy of the defaulter identification.

## Learnings from this project : 
I learned a lot from this project. I learned the importance of data collection and validation, model selection, results interpretation, and teamwork. I learned how to collect data from various sources, validate data for errors and inconsistencies, select the best model for a particular dataset, interpret the results of predictive models, and work effectively as part of a team. 
The skills I learned from this project will be valuable in my future career. I am interested in a career in data science, and the skills I learned in this project will help me succeed. I can use these skills to collect, validate, analyze, and interpret data to solve real-world problems. I am also grateful for the opportunity to have worked with a great team on this project. We all worked hard and learned a lot from each other.
